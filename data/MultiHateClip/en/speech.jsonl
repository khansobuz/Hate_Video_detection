This causes the blood supply to that area being cut off. This is when the real countdown begins. A person has about six hours to get the ball untwisted before the ball is lost forever. If left untreated, the lack of blood supply results in ischemia and eventually necrosis. This is tissue death. The affected ball turns black. This necrotic ball can become infected. This localized infection can then spread to the surrounding groin, pelvis and even enter the bloodstream causing a body-wide infection called sepsis. And if sepsis isn't treated urgently, it can be lethal. So please kindly refrain from doing this."}

Angry, Zeus blinded him and put him on an island, where there was a lot of food, however, Phineas could not eat anything, because the harpies would steal his food before he could eat it. Years later, Jason and the Argonauts arrived at the island, managing to drive the harpies away.

Their massive wingspan can reach up to 7 feet, and their striking gray and black feathers make them stand out in the forest canopy. The harpy eagle's adaptations make it a top predator in its environment. The harpy eagle can spot prey from over 200 feet away, and its powerful beak can crush bones. During breeding season, the harpy eagle's unique courtship dance involves calling out and flapping their wings to attract a mage. Unfortunately, the harpy eagle's distribution is limited due to deforestation and hunting. In some cultures, the harpy eagle is considered a symbol of power and hunted for their feathers.

Genetics play a significant role in determining penis size, but hormones and nutrition during fetal development and childhood can also have an impact. Most penis growth occurs during puberty, and the penis tends to stop growing by the time you're an adult. Global studies suggest that the average penis length is around 5 inches when erect. Pretty much the only evidence-backed way to increase penis size is via surgery, but that comes with its own risk factors. Masturbation does not increase or decrease penis size."}

We all need to be accountable. We all need to take ownership of what we're bringing to the table and what message we're putting out there."}

{"vid":"de4NWDu3GeY","transcript":" If you're worried about whether or not you can please your girlfriend in bed because you have a small penis, consider the fact that lesbians typically report greater sexual satisfaction than women in relationships with men. And what does this indicate? That not only the size of the penis, but even the presence of a penis is often far less relevant to women's pleasure than we imagine. What's much more relevant is a knowledge and understanding of how vulvas work. Keep in mind, for example, that consistent and focused stimulation of the clitoris is among the most reliable route to orgasms for most vulva owners, and that fingering and oral sex are among the most effective ways to provide clitoral stimulation, neither of which have anything to do with penis size. Plus, even for penetration, think about it. If a finger can work, then you don't really need a super big penis for it to feel good, right? What matters far more than the size or shape of any body part is simply a willingness and enthusiasm to communicate with your partner and make her pleasure a priority."}

And in California they have the alcoholic beverage control. This department has something called the minor decoy program where they get people that are under age 20 and the undercover cop will go in with this minor decoy and order an alcoholic drink from a bartender or server. In the U.S. you have to be 21 years old, right? So the under 20 person will order, and if you are the server or the bartender and you don't make sure they have a legal ID before serving them the drink, you're busted. This is what happens. The undercover cop will then make you reenact handing the drink to the minor decoy, and they take a photo of it for everybody to see, and then you are fined. It's a misdemeanor, you're fined. Also the bar or restaurant gets fined. So don't be offended, particularly in California. And if this happens in other states, let me know. But the server or bartender is probably scared that they're going to get fined or whatever. So that's it."}

An acting president is someone who carries out the powers and duties of the American president even though that person actually doesn't hold the office. And both Cheney and Harris did this because the Constitution says that the Vice President is first in line to serve as acting president. For 85 minutes on November 19, 2021, Harris became the first woman with presidential power when President Joe Biden was under anesthesia for a colonoscopy. Cheney was acting president twice, also during colonoscopies. On both June 29, 2002 and July 21, 2008, Cheney served as acting president when President George W. Bush was also under anesthesia for colonoscopies. The only other time in American history when a vice president served as acting president was when George H.W.

I gently folded that into the cake batter and poured it onto my pattern. smoothed it out popped it in the oven and just like that it's baked and i had to roll it up right away so it wouldn't crack as you can see i was very excited it came out in one piece while that's completely cooling i cut up my raspberries and made my whipped cream filling and this is my strong suit working with frosting so i was very excited to fill this cake and put all the raspberries. Then I had to re-roll it into the official heart shape and let it chill in the fridge for four hours, which was not fun because I just wanted to eat it right away, but it was definitely worth the wait. It ended up looking orangey on camera, but I swear it's pink. I had the best time making it and an even better time eating it."}

They are found in the tropical rainforests of Central and South America, where they live in the canopy layer of the forest. The harpy eagle is known for its tail. This crest is used for communication and displays during courtship. They have extremely sharp talons that are the size of grizzly bear claws and can exert a force of over 500 pounds per square inch, making them one of the strongest gripping forces in the animal kingdom. The harpy eagle is a top predator in its ecosystem, feeding on a variety of prey including monkeys, sloths, and other birds. They are known for their powerful hunting skills and can take down prey that is several times their own size and weight. Despite being a fierce predator, the harpy eagle is also a devoted parent. They mate for life and take turns caring for their young, with both parents participating in feeding and protecting their offspring. Unfortunately, the harpy eagle is considered to be a threatened species due to habitat loss and poaching."}

How do you navigate it if you're very horny, for example? Yeah, so I think it comes down to the person. Once you're with someone, you're with them for them. It doesn't really matter what they have to offer. They just have themselves. Whether you want pee-pee sometimes or something from the female, navigate through it and you just realize you're there for them and you're not there for any other desires at the end of the day. What would you say like your biggest struggle being bisexual person? Girls are not so understanding whereas guys are. They'll be fine with you being bi. They realize you can have fun with both. If they're a bisexual girl, I think it's much easier because they understand you can just sometimes want things from other people."}

It was said to be a personification of storm winds and was known for its swift and deadly attacks. In Greek mythology, there were two main harpies, Alo and Ossipede. They were daughters of the sea god Thomas and the oceanid Electra. They were often depicted as fierce creatures with sharp claws and teeth and the ability to fly at great speeds. The harpies were notorious for their habit of stealing food. In fact, the word harpy is derived from the Greek word harpine, which means to snatch. They were said to swoop down on unsuspecting victims and carry off their food or even their children. The harpies were also known for their association with punishment.

A STEM professor at the Carly Gay Jepsen University developed a comprehensive system that assigns negative and positive values to everything a child can encounter. After running simulations, they published their findings as a ranked list of people most likely to cause harm to children. Homosexuals were not only harmless, but actually a good influence on children, as they inspired self-expression and didn't instill religious guilt at the age of five. Tell me all your secrets. But while homosexuals are great for kids, kids are not great for homosexuals. The toll on the gay body is devastating. Children are annoying. They're loud. They shit their pants. They don't understand social cues. They're sticky. And worst of all, they're horrible storytellers. And then he, and then, and then. The mere presence of children picks away at the gay immune system and in as little as five minutes can leave them ino-toe state. If you see a child approaching a gay, step in and do something. You might save a life. So while homosexuals are well-groomed, they are not groomers. They don't think of children that way. They don't even think of children.

Their song is said to be so beautiful and mesmerizing that it can captivate even the strongest minds. Harpies are known to live in small tribes, led by a matron.

They are opportunistic hunters and pillagers, who use their wings to swoop down on unsuspecting victims and snatch their possessions or prey.

{"vid":"BTq7E17OebY","transcript":" 3 Size and Shape related facts about the penis Let's start with the most obvious one that freaks a lot of people out. Let's talk about size. How big is an average penis? That actually depends on whether or not you are measuring the penis when it's hard and erect or when it's soft and loose. When it's soft and loose, the average size is 3 inches. When it's hard and erect, it's anywhere between 4 to 6 inches. So you are probably freaking out about your penis size and being misled by a point. Throw that out of the window. Your penis is fine however it is. The second thing. What is the correct shape of your penis? Is a slight bend okay? A slight bend like this is probably alright. But if you are facing a bend like this, then this is a problem. This can be an indication of something called Peyronie's disease. This makes sex and erections very very painful. You probably need to speak to your doctor about this because there's a lot of scar tissue that's involved in this which can make things painful. The last, can surgery change the size of your penis? Yes, surgery is the only option that actually works on changing the size of your penis."}

It is distinctly the largest eagle in the world, it has a wingspan of about 6 feet when spread wide, they are big gamers in the Amazonian wild and terrorize deer, monkeys, and sloths. Forget all their appellations, they are not intimidating and can be awfully quiet when away from their nesting areas. Their prey will feel some dread, though as this bird is at the top of the food chain and a threat to animals of its size. Harpy is the national bird of Panama due to its appearance and size, it is considered one of the most powerful and largest raptors globally. The length of the rear talons is about 4 to 5 inches, just the same as a grizzly bear's claws. Those talons give the harpy enough power and grip to lift prey up to their own weight. Its facial disc feathers can be lowered or lifted at will like an owl, this process helps them direct sound waves to their ears to improve hearing. Its eyesight is 8 times better than humans and when locked on a potential meal, they fly below the forest canopy and swoop in to catch their prey. Subscribe for more videos."}

Born into a middle-class family in the Netherlands, she faced adversity after her parents' separation and the loss of her mother. Leaving behind a tumultuous marriage, she pursued her passion for dance and entertainment. In Paris, Mata Hari achieved fame as an exotic dancer, captivating the attention of influential men and becoming involved with military officials and politicians. However, her career began to decline over time as she aged. During World War I, her frequent travels between countries raised suspicions. For this reason, she was recruited by the French, with the promise that she could visit her wounded lover in exchange for information. Although Mata Hari was coerced, she was soon discovered by the Germans. In October 1917, at the age of 41, she was convicted and executed."}

{"vid":"SV2tUum00Xk","transcript":" Have you ever known someone who wholeheartedly believed that had special powers? I know someone who totally, wholeheartedly believes that they are a Jedi Master. Our families go way back, so I happen to know other kids were merciless to him all through childhood. He's always had problems, though. Kind of one of those people you can feel aren't quite right, but not exactly why. He decided he was a Jedi Master one day. Just like Out of the Blue, credit where credit is due, he went all the way with it. Became a minor nerd celebrity for a while. At first, when people challenged the Jedi thing, why don't you have powers then? He'd say, Jedi is a mindset, not a power. Or sometimes, you don't know the powers I may have, and try to play it off like a joke, but the dude was 100% serious. If you pushed, he would outright melt down with tears and screaming. Apparently, his parents financially supported him pretty much entirely, until he, and this part confuses the crap out of me, got married and had a kid while still insisting on the Jedi thing. After that, the wife supported him. Eventually, he got tired of that and left his family to take off with a teenager he met at a convention. That's when we cut ties with him. You can be a Jedi all you want, but cutting and leaving your kid is some scythe lord shit."}

If not, just right directly through your midfoot. And the second factor is what I call pulling the slack out of the bar, which looks and sounds like this. You hear that?

If you don't pull the slack out of the bar, you're going to be jerking the weight up and it makes it a lot easier for you to lose your brace.

{"vid":"DTcm4d7S4Fs","transcript":" So there are a lot of secular reasons as to why grape is wrong, but I would also like to point out how there are a lot of instances in the Old Testament where God seemingly approves of grape in one way or another. The entire system where the man pays for a woman is graping the woman. Like, in the sexual aspect of being in a marriage or marrying somebody, if you're paying for that person and not getting their consent, then that is raping them. It's a form of sexual slavery. God obviously doesn't have a problem with rape. He doesn't have a problem prescribing grape in certain instances in order for his people to propagate and multiply, as he said in the Bible."}

{"vid":"1Dpv_CJsa-g","transcript":" Here's the story of one of my patients who came to me with complaints of right shoulder snapping and pain with every dumbbell bench press. The first thing I did, assess technique. I noticed in the bottom of his bench press, he had a lot of shoulder extension, meaning his elbow was dropping really far down. Now, why is this an issue? Well, whenever you're performing a dumbbell bench press or a barbell bench press, if you drop that elbow too far down and go into excessive extension, it can lead to excessive load on the front side of the shoulder, which for him was causing his symptoms because of a lack of stability. It's not that this is a bad exercise, but if you drop that elbow too low, it can just place a lot of load on the front side of the shoulder. So my cue for him was to set his shoulder blades into a good position by retracting them at the start of the movement. This allowed him to perform that dumbbell bench press, but with better shoulder mechanics, less stress on the front of the shoulder, and no more snapping."}

It isn't bad or wrong and there's no right age per se, but if you're a parent and you see your child touching themselves instead of being angry or alarmed, it's just helpful to tell them that this is something that should only be done in private. Some studies indicate that this gratification behavior has even been seen demonstrated by fetuses while still in the womb. Masturbation is a perfectly normal and healthy behavior.

{"vid":"1fglv1fiibc","transcript":" This is Gay Science. In today's episode, why do gay relationships feel longer than straight ones? Time is a theoretical social construct created by humans, and more specifically, share. Straight relationships progress on an average curve. Gay women accelerate quickly and level off, while gay men go nuclear. By the time straight people are on their third date, lesbians have combined and hyphenated their last names, and gay men have already broken up, with their next relationship after this one. This is in part because gay men have no patience for literally anything and need you to get to the point. The homosexual experience is skipping the game's built-in tutorial, even though you could probably use it. They're at 300%, and we haven't even picked our characters yet. While a straight man is on one date, a gay man has been on several, one with his actual date, a mini-date with the server, while sending vibes to a guy at another table whose date is also sending vibes to your date and on their own mini-date with the same server. This is the homosexual byproduct of wanting something better, sometimes to a fault. A heterochronic timeline is actually holding us back, and a homochronic one is more evolved. If society adopted this timeline, we'd cure more diseases, pass more legislation, have better national holidays, and Glenn Close would finally have her goddamn Oscar."}

So then our success or failure in the relationship becomes entirely encased in this one thing. We are more than just our sexual orientations.

Now you may be asking yourself, wait, who are these sisters and what exactly are they indulging in? Well, apparently this is a group of male drag queens who dress up as Catholic nuns to mock Christianity. The invitation angered many Catholics, understandably, which led the Dodgers to disinvite the sisters and that in turn offended the LGBTQIA plus community. I think I got them all. And with any dispute between Christianity and unorthodox sexuality, we know which wins. And right on cue, the Dodgers issued an apology and re-invited the sisters to gay pride night in hopes they would accept a community hero award."}

Its eyesight is eight times better than humans, and when locked on a potential meal, they fly below the forest canopy and swoop in to catch their prey.

And that worked for me then, but I always felt this enormous pressure to come out, to be open. That pressure to come out, to be open, affects a lot of us. The message we get is, your identity isn't legitimate unless you're sharing it with others, unless it is something the world has access to. Your A-spec identity, the experience you're having, and the way you decide to understand it and label it is legitimate whether you're open about it or not. No one can take away the truth of who you are simply because you may choose for a short time or for always to keep that truth to yourself."}
{"vid":"NNeWDl7qxoQ","transcript":" I know I look like I'd be really nice, but I was actually a menace when I first started working full-time. Turns out your coworkers don't appreciate commentary on how they could get better at their jobs. It's not my fault that other people's mistakes are just more intellectually stimulating to talk about. Besides, if I asked about their weekend plans, they'd tell me. And who has time for all that? I don't. So, probably tired of my nonsense and maybe tired of getting complaints, my supervisor made me a deal. I could text her all of my rude thoughts as long as I didn't say them out loud. In return, she promised to give some sort of response, even if it was just like a string of empathetic emojis. A few months of keeping this arrangement resulted in two things. One, increased self-awareness. Slowing down to type your thoughts because you might get in trouble for saying the wrong ones out loud really forces you to think before you speak. And two, improvement in my workplace relationships. Being more thoughtful about what I let come out of my mouth gave me space to have more conventional interactions, even if it was under the threat of punishment."}

And I think we can be so desensitized to the words of Christ there. And the reality is, if that's what's going on, you need to say that out loud. I am committing adultery with my wife and you need to act like it. Right. It's it's a big deal. Whether you're watching porn or not. And that's a high standard to live up to that.

{"vid":"GCTnb9sES5E","transcript":" Qing Shi, a prostitute turned pirate queen. In the early 19th century, a formidable figure emerged in the South China Sea. Born as Shi Yang in 1775 in Guangdong province, her life took an unexpected turn when she was forced into a life of piracy after marrying Cheng Yi, a notorious pirate captain, in 1801. Cheng Ai rescued her from a life as a prostitute, and their partnership soon evolved into both a romantic and piratical one. Adopting the title Cheng Yi Cao, meaning Widow of Cheng Yi, she solidified her authority as a leader. Under Ching Shih's command, the Red Flag Fleet struck fear into the hearts of many. They ruthlessly captured ships and raided coastal villages, establishing a reign of terror across the South China Sea and Southeast Asian waters. Ching Shih's past as a prostitute did not define her. Rather, it was her unparalleled skills, resilience, and leadership that propelled her to the forefront of piracy during this era."}

This was a ceremony practised historically in Orthodox Christian tradition to unite together two people of the same sex, normally men, in a church-recognised relationship similar to siblinghood. These ceremonies often included all things in a typical wedding, the couple blessed at the altar together and usually a big banquet to celebrate after. These two particular men were tortured and beheaded once their secret sexuality was exposed because it wasn't meant to be a sexual thing. And then they were both stripped of their sainthood by the church in 1969. But you know, it's our history. However, the close friendship between St Sergius and Zimbakas was emphasised throughout history, making them one of the most well-known examples of paired saints. So we've got that."}
{"vid":"_pncuXfYwcw","transcript":" Singapore has lifted a ban on gay sex, so why are some LGBT activists unhappy? After years of debate, a controversial law known as 377A has been scrapped, basically making it legal to be homosexual. This will bring the law into line with current social models and I hope provide some relief to gay Singaporeans. LGBT rights groups celebrated, but they also raised concerns about this. Under the law, only marriages between one man and one woman are recognised in Singapore. In the same speech, the Prime Minister said that the constitution would be changed to keep marriage between a man and a woman to reflect Singapore's conservative values. LGBT activists said this was really disappointing and will make it harder for same-sex marriage to ever be legalised. Some Singaporeans argued that since 377A hasn't been enforced in years, the country hadn't actually made any progress."}

They are driven by a need to cause constant pain, suffering, and death. And this is because Harpies were created from a curse that was caused by an elf who fell in love with a god. The elf tried to win the god's favor with a beautiful song, but the god wasn't interested. This caused the elf to transform into what is now known as the harpy. And her love that she had for that god turned into hate. These days harpies use a song similar to the progenitor in order to lure victims in. It's said to hear a harpy's song is to hear the most beautiful music in the world. And it's usually the last thing you'll hear because the harpies use this song to lure the victims off of cliffs or into the caves of dangerous creatures.

Their thick legs, strong toes and their sharp talons, makes this species a formidable predator. Fully grown Harpy Eagles are at the top of the food chain. They possess extremely large talons, and have been recorded as carrying prey, weighing up to their own body weight. Though identified as the most powerful raptors, their wingspan is comparatively smaller in size than some eagle species. They can grow up to length of about 3 to 4 feet and weigh around 8 kilograms, with the females being larger than the males. Their diet mainly includes tree-dwelling mammals like sloths and monkeys. They also feed on other animals like foxes, porcupines, deers, opossum and many other. Harpy eagles are found in Central and South America, until Argentina. They are predominantly found in Brazil."}

It is perhaps one of the most intimidating birds in the world, with its retractable feather crown and razor-sharp talons that are about 4 to 5 inches, just the same as a grizzly bear's claws. Those talons give the harpy enough power and grip to lift prey up to their own weight. This eagle is a silent predator that glides across the forest like a stealth drone despite its wingspan reaching up to six and a half feet. Harpies feed on sloths, opossums, and monkeys. Instead of migrating, they stay in one place and establish their territory. Monogamous and with a lifespan of 35 to 45 years, a bonded pair may stay together for 25 to 30 years."}

So somebody abuses you, somebody that you were supposed to be able to trust. They do something horrible, whether that's physical, sexual, financial, spiritual, emotional, psychological. They're hurting you deliberately, knowing that it's harming you, they're doing it anyway. And they push and they push and they push and they push and finally you reach your breaking point and maybe you call them a name or you throw something or you hit them, you freak out because guess what? You've been putting up with it for a really long time. And you're abusive? You're abusive because you finally cracked under all this pressure? No, you are a human being who has been treated like you are nothing. You're not abusive for reacting to abuse. Reactive abuse is an indicator that you need safety and you need it right now."}

{"vid":"tenwWTmdRrg","transcript":" Everyone loves a rags-to-riches story, but when Madame du Belly made it to the top, it blew up in her face. In just a few years, she went from homeless teenager to the most in-demand courtesan in France. Before long, she was sleeping with King Louis XV. His mistresses were usually women of noble birth, so you can imagine how this former courtesan blew his mind. The king was hopelessly infatuated with her, so they forged some documents so that she could become his chief mistress. They spent eight happy and very expensive years together until tragedy struck. The king contracted smallpox and died. Marie Antoinette became the new queen and she immediately evicted Madame du Barry. On the rebound, she found herself at the center of a love triangle. One of them dumped her by writing, leave me alone on a painting, and the other one was beheaded by an angry mob who then tossed his head through her window. As royal mistress, she'd spent a lot of money and made a lot of enemies. Madame du Barry represented everything that the French people hated, and so, during the Revolution, she faced the same fate as her one-time enemy, Marie Antoinette. They even ended up buried in the same cemetery."}
{"vid":"M0DwobyOi20","transcript":" The majestic world of the harpy eagle. This bird, among the largest and most powerful eagles, reigns over its kingdom from the treetops. With a wingspan of over two meters, it commands the skies with grace and precision. Renowned for their strength, harpy eagles can snatch up prey, weighing up to half their body weight. Monkeys, sloths, and other tree-dwelling creatures often fall victim to their powerful talons. Yet, they are not mindless predators. Harpy eagles are devoted parents, nurturing their young for nearly two years before they venture off on their own. Despite their awe-inspiring presence, harpy eagles are facing threats. Deforestation and hunting have dramatically dwindled their numbers, placing them on the list of near threatened species. But hope is not lost. Conservation efforts are underway, striving to protect and preserve the habitats of these magnificent birds."}

Now as we all know, the acephobia is very real and most of these things have been told either to me or people in my comments have said that it has been told to them. So this video is a big conglomeration of things you shouldn't say to asexual people. Starting off this list with number 10 is you just haven't found the right person yet. I feel like this is one of the most common things for people who come out somewhere on the asexual spectrum to hear. If this is someone's first response to you coming out, first of all, that's not okay. And second of all, it's super invalidating for a couple of reasons. It's the other person just assuming that they know your feelings more than you know your own. And also they're acting like there's some magical person out there who will someday make you feel the attraction that you are so lacking. So please don't say this to an ace person. We hear it a lot and it would be nice to be able to come out to people and not hear this and be around people who genuinely support and respect our sexuality."}

And as it is written in 1 Corinthians chapter 15, verse 1, KJV version, Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ?

I had never made a vision board, but I wanted to really evoke a feeling of wealth. Oh, and I also took a passport photo that I kind of ate up. Baes gave us all Stanley cups and I stole all of the tequila ondas. After the event, I headed to the gym where I had a lazy day. I am so sore and I don't even know from what. And when it's raining, it means that me and my boyfriend are going to Disneyland because the parks are literally empty. We didn't wait in one line. I am fully a Disney adult and I don't even feel bad about it. You can make fun of me if you want. We watched World of Color from the jellyfish ride and I wanted to try this espresso martini from Pimm's Kitchen and it did not disappoint. I love an espresso martini and this one was fabulous. We did the cars on Main Street and called it a night. Bye!"}
{"vid":"wIOygasuA9c","transcript":" How do I respond to someone who justifies abortion by using instances of rape and incest? That's a very good question, and you will realize that the left always has to argue in extremes because they know that it does not validate their arguments to argue with the majority. So here's pretty much how you look at the instance. First off, ask them a question. It's always good when you're arguing to see what knowledge they have. And the first question I would ask them is how many pregnancies are derived from rape instances and get the answer from them. It's obviously going to be very low. And then you say, do you believe that that justifies the slaughter of this many million babies that's taking place every year? Do you think that that justifies the slaughter of 19 million other babies? The majority of these circumstances are not happening because people are being raped, obviously. It's happening because people are irresponsible and people are starting to look at abortion as a birth control mechanism. And of course, the answer to that question is absolutely not. It does not justify it."}

Her husband sends his love to her every night. When she disturbs her husband by doing a workout up there. Sorry am I distracting you from your work? Are you kidding me? They distracted me from you. Go ahead. The wife grew to love sitting on the wall. Plus her husband gives her a different gift every day. Today it's gold and silver jewelry. Tomorrow it's all kinds of flowers.

Probably the largest harems in the world, it is said that there was a harem of 16,000 in the 6th century BCE King Tamba of Banaras, India. Minghuang had a good chance of being king when he acceded to the throne in 712 AD until 740, the country was a thriving one. The emperor was a big fan of literature, as well as music. He ordered a census to find out the beauty of his empire's women, dissatisfied with the 3,000 women in his palace.

It had the iconic monogram print all over, and it was in this beautiful pastel yellow color. Plus, it was also brand new with tags. And sitting right next to it, I found another coach bag. This bag kind of reminds me of the coach version of a Birkin bag. It has a similar shape and that buckle detail in the front, but I like this one specifically because I'm a sucker for the monogram print. My look in the bag section just kept continuing because I also found this beautiful hobo bag that featured the coolest braided details on the strap. And to my surprise, when I opened the bag up, this bag was also a coach bag. I genuinely couldn't believe my luck.

The practice of homosexuality is called an unnatural state rooted in the fallen human nature. Number five is practicing homosexuals will not inherit the kingdom of God. Not those Christians who struggle with homosexuality but those who identify themselves as gay. They are no longer finding their identity in Christ. They are finding their identity in their sexuality. Number six is homosexuals can be saved like every other sinner. 1 Corinthians 6, verse 11 it says, There is hope for you. If you are a are homosexual, turn to Christ, repent of your sin.

In an audio recording posted on the Facebook page Buhay Kingdom 2024, Quiboloy calls the former workers who testified about the alleged abuses bogus witnesses. Kibuloy also calls Tuesday's public inquiry by the Senate bogus and that it turned him into a monster. Ontiveros issued a subpoena to Kibuloy after he ignored the initial hearing. Former KOJC members testify they were subjected to hazing-like punishments for breaking church rules. Jerome says his genitals felt like they were on fire for three weeks after being rubbed with chili, allegedly on orders from Kibuloy, after he went on a date with his non-KOJC girlfriend."}

It is the strongest pound-four-pound bird on the planet. Its enormous talons can be up to around 5 inches, longer than a bear's claw and can exert 500 pounds of pressure, crushing the bones of its prey. Its legs are the size of an adult man's wrist, and once it has latched onto its prey, there is no escaping. Females are larger than males and weigh up to 20 pounds. Its 2-meter wingspan is short and broad relative to its body size, an adaptation that allows them to fly through the tangle of branches. As with all raptors, it has little tolerance for intruders in its territory, especially if it is raising young. If that intruder happens to be a BBC cameraman installing a harpy cam, the damage it could inflict includes rendering the cameraman unconscious or piercing his kidney. A harpy eagle is capable of reaching speeds of 50 miles per hour and its excellent vision can see something smaller than one inch from almost 700 feet."}

{"vid":"W1-Xlw_Q8cQ","transcript":" Deep in the heart of the Amazon rainforest lives a creature that inspires awe and fear in equal measure. Meet the harpy eagle, one of the largest and most powerful birds of prey in the world. With a wingspan of up to 7 feet, and a weight of up to 20 pounds, the harpy eagle is a formidable predator that rules the canopy of the forest. Its talons are among the largest and strongest of any bird, capable of crushing bones and tearing flesh with ease. The harpy eagle's diet consists mainly of sloths, monkeys, and other mammals that inhabit the treetops. Its hunting strategy is to ambush its prey from above, using its powerful wings and sharp eyesight to surprise and overwhelm them. Despite its size and power, the harpy eagle is a rare and elusive creature that is seldom seen by humans. But its presence in the forest is a sign of a healthy ecosystem, where predators and prey coexist in a delicate balance."}

However, they found opportunities within their struggles, achieving social elevation, protection, and even experiencing motherhood. Their experiences provide us with a unique viewpoint of historical power dynamics, societal norms, and gender relations. Their stories make us ponder about current gender roles and relationships. Their narratives provoke contemplation about today's gender roles and relationships, serving as a poignant reminder that strength and hope persist, even in the face of adversity."}

At least that's what they tell the straight ones. Why do they love their gay sons so much? Gay men have a queer-to-pan syndrome. They don't want to grow up, living in nostalgia, refusing to do things adults should be doing. Moms also enjoyed this time period and wish they could go back. Moms are dramatic, and gay men are good storytellers. Compare the one-word answers moms get when texting their straight children versus the elaborate drama the gay ones provide. A casual conversation will include protagonists, detailed environments, redemption arcs, and a twist ending. Moms are emotional, and gay men have a higher emotional intelligence. The gay son is sensitive to what's happening in the family and often the only one who can get on mom's level to see that dad's a f***ing asshole. They also share a mutual frustration of simultaneously being attracted to and repulsed by men. Mothers with gay sons just know more.

Their talons are so strong that they can crush bones with ease. This bird is truly a sight to behold as it soars through the skies with its massive wingspan and fierce gaze. The Harpy Eagle is a threatened species due to habitat loss and hunting. Did you know that the Harpy Eagle is considered a symbol of power and strength in some indigenous cultures? Thank you for watching."}

She hated being called the British Marilyn Monroe, but let's face it, she was the British Marilyn Monroe. She was a blonde bombshell who kept the tabloids busy. She won a beauty contest at age 13 and started acting. She appeared older than she was. Her roles slowly got better. She started many British films, TV shows, and plays before moving to Hollywood. She'd go back to England and appear in movies and come back to Hollywood a lot. Her second husband was Richard Dawson who would later host the game show called The Family Feud. She always remained captivating even in her older years. She recorded a solo album and made a few songs for soundtracks. She was married three times and had three children. She died in 1984 from ovarian cancer. Her last husband named Alan Lake was so distraught that he committed suicide five months after she died. She was 52 years old."}

Every time someone says this, we have to mention Kid Conner. For those who don't know, he played a bisexual character in Heartstopper. And then the internet proceeded to force him to come out. Because they didn't like the fact that a straight actor was playing a bisexual actor. You cannot legally ask someone their sexuality for work. That's invasion of privacy. Because your sexuality is whose business? Yours. Not for the public, not for the person who's hiring you. If you truly want this to be a thing, don't you know that people can lie? Like how a lot of people already lie on college applications? And even if they were, you would still probably say, they don't seem like a lesbian to me. They don't give off bisexual vibes. There's no personality trait behind a sexuality. Get that out of your head. I think we all can agree, it is frustrating to not see queer people play queer characters. However, comma, if you're gonna be frustrated by this, be frustrated by the producers, the people who casted them. The actors are just acting. That is their job."}

{"vid":"QihIpSnlOzM","transcript":" Welcome to Queer History 101 Part 3. We all know the rainbow flag as the symbol of the LGBTQ plus community. But why? The rainbow flag was created in 1978 by artist, veteran and drag performer Gilbert Baker. He was commissioned to create a flag for San Diego's Pride Parade by another gay icon, politician Harvey Milk. The different colours within the flag are intended to represent togetherness since LGBTQ plus people come in all races, ages and genders, and rainbows are both natural and beautiful. The original flag featured eight colours, each having a different meaning. Hot pink for sex, red for life, orange for healing, yellow for sunlight, green for nature, turquoise for art, indigo for harmony, violet for spirit. Some flags added black and brown stripes to honour black and brown members of the community. A recent update is the progress flag, which features the chevron to the side of the original flag to honor trans as well as black and brown community members."}

Jamie, boy, we's in the thick of World War II, and goddammit, those Japanese are controlling all the rubber we need. Invest a synthetic rubber substitute? Rubber, rubber, silicone oil and borax, borax, boric acid. So he mixes silicone oil and boric acid. But rubber is supposed to be rubber. And James's mix wasn't a solid or liquid. It could kind of flow, but then it also bounced and stretched and randomly could transfer newspaper ink onto itself. I'll call you Nutty Putty. Who's a good Nutty Putty? Then after the war ended, James rebranded his putty as Silly Putty and his real solid liquid sold 300 million units."}

I do begrudge people mistaking their sexuality for some massively important signifier, which demands that other people then not just respect them, but pay them some special dues. And actually, in actual fact, you could see this. I've stumbled across pride a couple of times in my time. I've never gone, but I've stumbled across it a few times. And one of the things is on a simple matter of aesthetics, a taste that I deeply dislike is seeing a bunch of disco gays on top of a bus waving to the public as if they're celebrities. Sorry, love, you're not a celebrity, you're just gay. That's all. And you shouldn't treat the general public as your audience waiting for them to celebrate the magnificent, wonderful you.

{"vid":"TfPv2KiLOrs","transcript":" Why monks enjoyed male prostitute services. During the Edo period in Japan, there were male prostitutes called kagema. They were originally young boys who were training to become an onnagata in kabuki theater, which were male actors that played female roles. In order for the young boys to understand the feelings of women more, they were forced to have relationships with men. Eventually, there were some kagema that became full-time male prostitutes, which created the image of kagema equals prostitutes. There were some women who received their services too, but most of their customers were actually Buddhist monks, and that's why the brothels were often built near temples. But why? This is because in most sects in Buddhism in Japan, monks were forbidden to have sexual relationships with women because refusing all desires was a part of their training. So some monks thought, but no one said it's forbidden to have relationships with men, right?

Having the wings, talons, and head of a bird, and the breasts, arms, face, and female parts of a woman, their name apparently means snatchers, as they were known to steal food and people away. Luckily, they mostly took away bad people with the goddesses of vengeance and retribution, Irenaeus of the Furies. A known legend with them involves King Phineas of Thrace was given a gift of prophecy. However, King Phineas used it to betray Zeus by uncovering his secrets, which obviously angered him. So Zeus blinded him and sent him off to an island with a buffet of food. The last bit sounds a bit weird until he decides to send a bunch of harpies to eat the food in front of him so he could never indulge in it.

Once, they kidnapped the daughters of the king of Miletus, Pandarios, and took them to provide services to a group of female spirits known as the Furies. These spirits were very powerful.

These solitary hunters have a lifespan of about 20 years and possess incredible strength and sharp talons. They are known for their formidable hunting abilities and intimidating appearance. The fascinating thing about harpy eagles is that they have the largest talons of any bird of prey, and they are capable of carrying off prey as large as monkeys and sloths. They primarily feed on large mammals such as monkeys, sloths, and squirrels. Sadly, harpy eagles are considered threatened due to habitat destruction and human expansion into their territory.

{"vid":"ogsMoRZXFuk","transcript":" Welcome to Freedom to Readem. Did you know that genderqueer is the most banned book in the country? It has been removed from school districts and libraries across the country sometimes without a formal complaint. When the book came out, what it was met with initially was just this absolute wave of love and support, and the pushback didn't come until late 2021, says author Maya Kobabe. As a book sanctuary, CPL is committed to protect endangered books, make endangered books broadly accessible, and educate others on the history of book banning and burning. You can learn more about book sanctuaries and how to become one at booksanctuary.org. And you can check out genderqueer and other endangered books at chipublib.org."}

Homosexual behavior is a sin, not homosexual feelings. We all have attractions we ought not act on, right? There's a difference between attractions and actions. I have attractions I ought not act on. So to be attracted to someone of the same sex, if you act on that, it's a sin. That's what the Bible says. That's what Jesus says. You say, well, Jesus never talked about homosexuality. No, he talked about all sexual immorality because whenever he used the phrase sexual immorality, that meant any sexual activity outside of the marriage of a man and a woman. Fornication, adultery, homosexuality, bestiality, rape, incest, whatever it is."}

Gay marriage has been included in some of our laws, so it's not something that the Supreme Court has to decide anymore. But on the other side, the families are not, especially conservative families, they're not very accepting. In my case, I had a very bad experience with my family came out several times first time I came out it was like I'm coming out But I'm gonna try to fix it and do like therapy and stuff So I did do some like conversion therapy things as long as I was trying to get fixed They were okay with it with me trying so I wasn't actually gay in their mind I was just like going through a phase.
